purpose of this document is providing requirements and specifications about
 an application due to monitoring process done by city of Milan.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The application will be called 'SmartCityAdvisor' and its scope will be
 provide to citizen more information about pubblic service situation, like
 hospital queues or parking availability, and to manage in the best possible
 way exceptional event like accidents, VIPs arrival or other, with a momentary
 traffic deviation.
 The objective of this project is improve the city life through a mobile
 application, that will allow to recive notifications about actual traffic
 situation or about momentary deviation, according to own GPS position,
 and also it will allow to check which is the empiest hospital in case of
 emergency or which is the best one for a precise emergency.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

As required by city of Milan, as new functionality i will propose the parking
 availability, that is possible with data already measured.: the idea is
 that citizens will indicate the destination in the mobile app and system
 will propose all the possible solutions with free place.
 A possible updating for parking situation should be each 10 minutes during
 the week ann each five minutes in the weekend or during festivities.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The system also provides Application Programming Interface (API) to enable
 further developments.

order to reach the scope, i will proposed a system with an interface develop
 both for web and smart device.
 Users will open the app and then they will choose what is their necessity
 : traffic situation, emergency or parking for example.
 Registration is not mandatory but it is strongly raccomended in order to
 be able to use all functionalities: for example, general notification could
 be recived only by registred users.
 With respect to the necessity to recive information, for example, about
 best way to do, will be necessary an internet connection.
 The system will interact with users directly via notification, via monitor
 (that are posed in the main streets) and, indirectly, with the management
 of traffic lights.

\begin_layout Description
[A4] We assume that special situation (as manifestation or VIP's visit)
 will be scheduled in advace;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
[A5] We assume that in case of accidents, they will be notify as soon as
 possible;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
[A6] We assume that when an accident happen, someone will call hospital
 or police and in that moment the first structure that will recive the help
 request will also insert it in the system, manually or by an automatic
 system
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
[A7] We assume that all hospital structure, all police stations, all car
 parks and the public transport company will answer in a positive way to
 this innovative solution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
[A8] We assume that Administration has created an organization in order
 to keeping on work each sensor and actuator in the city
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
[A9] We assume that after the period indicated fot a scheduled event, system
 will deleted it automatically.
 On the DB will be manteined a documentation about all passed events
