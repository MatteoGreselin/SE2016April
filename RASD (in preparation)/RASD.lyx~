\end_inset

this document is providing requirements and specifications about an application
 due to monitoring process done by city of Milan.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The application will be called 'SmartCityAdvisor' and its scope will be
 provide to citizen more information about pubblic service situation, like
 hospital queues or parking availability, and to manage in the best possible
 way exceptional event like accidents, VIPs arrival or other, with a momentary
 traffic deviation.
 The objective of this project is improve the city life through a mobile
 application, that will allow to recive notifications about actual traffic
 situation or about momentary deviation, according to own GPS position,
 and also it will allow to check which is the empiest hospital in case of
 emergency or which is the best one for a precise emergency.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

As required by city of Milan, as new functionality i will propose the parking
 availability, that is possible with data already measured.: the idea is
 that citizens will indicate the destination in the mobile app and system
 will propose all the possible solutions with free place.
 A possible updating for parking situation should be each 10 minutes during
 the week ann each five minutes in the weekend or during festivities.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The system also provides Application Programming Interface (API) to enable
 further developments.

reach the scope, i will proposed a system with a mobile platform.
 It is not necessary a web platform because each information will regards
 people that are driving or with an emergency that means with no time for
 starting a PC.
 Users will open the app and then they will choose what is their necessity
 : traffic situation, emergency or parking for example.
 Registration is not mandatory but it is strongly raccomended in order to
 be able to use all functionalities: for example, general notification could
 be recived only by registred users.

Tommaso needs to go to the city center with all the family.
 For this reason he has decided to use his car but he knows that the parking
 availability is a big problem in Milan.
 Tommaso will open the app and will select 'parking availability' in the
 main page; after that he will insert his destination, system will propose
 him all available parking at maximum 15 minutes walk for the prefixed zone
 with the number of remaing car park.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

In the first implementation of the service he could not do other things
 but probably, in the future, he could reserve the park for some minutes
 (five, then, fifteen....) and he will pay a price directly proportional with
 the time select.
